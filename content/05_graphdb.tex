\section{Motivation/Introduction}
First paragraph to state the general context and make important points for the motivation and why its important. Refer to Wood Paper here.

But Graph Database research has its beginnings already in the early 90s. During this time, numerous proposals came up, describing a semantic network to store data about the database. That was, because contemporary systems were failing to take into account the semantics of a database.
The Locial Data Model \autocite{KUPERLDM} was proposed, trying to combine the advantages of relational, hierarchical and network approaches in that they modeled databases as directed graphs, with leaves representing attributes and internal nodes posing as connections between the data. \\
Similar to that, the Functional Data Model \autocite{Shipman1979} was proposed with the same goal, focusing specifically on providing a conceptually natural database interface \autocite{Angles2018AnIT}. \\
During this period, most of the underlying theory of Graph Databases was created.
It was most likely because of insufficient hardware support for big graphs that this research declined, only to be picked up again now, powered by improved hardware. Todays focus in Graph Theory research lies primarily on actual practical systems and on the theoretical analysis of graph query languages \autocite{Angles2018AnIT}.

Especially practical implementations of Graph Database Theory have gained traction, as real world problems are more often than not interrelated - hence graphs are extremely useful in unterstanding the wide diversity of real-world datasets \autocite{Robinson2013}. \\
The emerging of social networks have naturally helped graph database models come up, with big players like Twitter and their implementation FlockDB entering the field. In those social network situations, a so-called social graph can effortlessly model attributes of a person as well as relationships between people. While in traditional RDBMS the apparent friend-of-a-friend-problem would be solved with a join over all relevant tables, in graph database technology this can be achieved with a traversal, which is far more cost inexpensive \autocite{Miller2013GraphDA}. \\
Another meaningful topic today are recommender systems, where most work focusing on optimizing machine learning algorithms. But also in database theory, this specific context poses challenges. However again, the graph model gracefully maps item similarities and correlations between user behaviour \autocite{Huang2002}.

These application fields bring very distinct workloads that require specific query languages to process. There are two different kinds of workload: in social network transactions low-latency online graphs are processed while for example link analysis algorithms evaluate high-throughput offline graphs \autocite{Angles2018AnIT}. Many query language proposals have come up recently, differing mainly in the underlying graph data structure/model and the functionality provided \autocite{Wood2012QueryLF}.

A deeper description of the theory behind graph databases will be given in subsection 2, aiming to connect the data model to its fields of application as well as comparing it to RDBMS. This comparison will be picked up in subsection 3, where a use case from the SQL world will be applied to Graph Database Theory, focusing in particular on Neo4j. Lastly, our findings will be stated in subsection 4 with a general conclusion.



\section{Graph Database Theory}
A graph database is a unique type of database designed to store data without transforming it into predefined structural models, whereby accessing and storing of relationships between data is as important as accessing and storing the data itself \autocite{neo4j:graphdb}. Graph databases offer Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) methods as an online, operational database management system. They focus on operation availability, transactional performance and integrity. Thus, graph databases are usually incorporated into Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems \autocite{graphdb2015}.

A graph database can be implemented with different concepts, non-native or native, for storage and request processing. Additionally, a data model must be chosen. The most common graph models are property graphs, hypergraphs and triples \autocite{graphdb2015}. For this eBook, the (labeled) property graph model will be examined because it is the most popular model in industry practice \autocite{graphdb2015} and the theoretical foundation of Neo4j \autocite{maheshlal2015}.


\subsection{Description of data model and functionality}
Before the explanation of the property graph model, a short recap of graphs is needed. There is no need for general graph theory, like search algorithms, to understand graph databases \autocite{graphdb2015}.

\subsubsection{Graph Basics}
A graph is a theoretical structure which represents a set of entities and their relationships, whereby entities are represented by nodes (vertices) and relationships by links between nodes (edges) \autocite{maheshlal2015, graphdb2015}. One-way relationships, like being the parent of someone, are represented as directed edges. On the contrary, two-way relationships, like being married to someone can be represented as two directed edges between both related nodes. Some literature tends to represent bidirectional (two-way) relationships as one undirected edge (e.g. an edge without arrows). It is more appropriate to use two directed edges because this is closer to an actual implementation where two physical pointers would exist. See figure \ref{fig:graphdb:graph_example} for an example.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img/graph_example.PNG}
    \caption{A graph representing a small family. Tom, Sarah and Peter are entities and thus represented as nodes (circles). The two-way relationship between Tom and Sarah, their marriage, is depicted as two directed edges. Lastly, Tom and Sarah are the parents of Peter and thus both have the relationship "Is parent of" directed towards Peter.}
    \label{fig:graphdb:graph_example}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{The property graph model}
The (labeled) property graph model is based on the theoretical graph from above \autocite{maheshlal2015}. It increases the overall information that a normal graph can store. Two such extensions, as the model name illustrates, are additional labels for each node and properties for nodes and edges. Figure \ref{fig:graphdb:property_graph_example} shows a labeled property graph.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img/property_graph_example.PNG}
    \caption{A labeled property graph representing a small family \autocite{maheshlal2015, graphdb2015}. Compared to figure \ref{fig:graphdb:graph_example} additional information can been stored.}
    \label{fig:graphdb:property_graph_example}
\end{figure}

\scalebox{1}{\textbf{Concepts of the property graph}}

\textbf{Nodes:} Like a normal graph, the property graph represents entities as nodes. The nodes in figure \ref{fig:graphdb:property_graph_example} are the circles of Tom, Sarah and Peter. Each node can have any number of properties (e.g.: "name: ‘Tom’" and  "id: 1") and multiple labels (e.g. " adult") \autocite{neo4j:graphdb}.

\textbf{Labels:} Nodes are tagged with labels which describe the role of the node within the system \autocite{maheshlal2015}. In figure \ref{fig:graphdb:property_graph_example}, the white text on black rectangles, "adult" and "child", are labels. Labels can also add metadata (constraints and indices) to the node \autocite{maheshlal2015, neo4j:graphdb}.

\textbf{Properties:} Properties are attributes (key-value pairs) of nodes or relationships. They are used to sore further information about the entity or relationship \autocite{maheshlal2015}. Each bold and non-italic written word in figure \ref{fig:graphdb:property_graph_example} is a key of a key-value pair property (e.g. "name:", "id:", "since:"). The content that follows the colon (e.g. "Peter", "3", "2017/02/02") is the value.

\textbf{Relationships:} Again, relationship are depicted as directed edges (links) between nodes. Relationships must have a name as well as a start and end node \autocite{graphdb2015} . In figure \ref{fig:graphdb:property_graph_example}, \texttt{"IS\textunderscore PARENT\textunderscore OF"} and \texttt{"IS\textunderscore MARRIED\textunderscore TO"} (the italic and bold written words) are the names of relationships. The text below ("since: […]") is the property of the relationship. Arrows indicate the direction of the relationship.  In practice, the direction is ignored and navigation through each edge (relationship) is possible \autocite{maheshlal2015, neo4j:graphdb}. Generally, relationships store cost quantities according to the usage of the system (e.g. distance, ratings, etc.) \autocite{neo4j:graphdb}.

\subsubsection{Storage}
\blockquote{Storage deals with how the data is stored physically and how it is represented logically when retrieved}\autocite{maheshlal2015}

One of the main tasks of a graph database system is to traverse relationships. As mentioned earlier, storing and accessing the relationships in a graph database is crucial. They are stored explicit (per directed edge) instead of being inferred from stored attributes (like primary/foreign keys in a relational model) \autocite{maheshlal2015} . Thus, any kind of storage system needs to be able handle the relationships explicitly. Graph databases can either use native graph storage, systems that are built for storing and accessing graphs, or non-native graph storage, systems that store adequately transformed graph data in relational or non-graph NoSQL databases \autocite{graphdb2015}.

\scalebox{1}{\textbf{Non-native graph storage}}

Non-native graph storage transforms the data from the graph model (e.g. property graph) into relational or other non-graph NoSQL database models (document-oriented, etc.). When accessing the data, the responsible system must rebuild (infer) the relationships at runtime. This is mostly done by a query engine which is responsible for executing incoming queries and thus fetching or changing the data (CRUD methods) \autocite{maheshlal2015} . In the case of a relational database management system (RDBMS), the query engine would first make the relationships explicit by inferring them through utilizing foreign keys and join-statements before returning or processing the data. This preprocessing results in more costly operations and inefficient traversing of relationships \autocite{maheshlal2015}. Non-native graph storage exists because it allows the use of well known, mature and well documented databases like MySQL \autocite{graphdb2015}.

\scalebox{1}{\textbf{Native graph storage}}

The key aspect of native graph storage is that it does not rely on actual indexes. The relationships between nodes within the graph are “natural adjacency”\autocite{graphdb2015}  indices. Thus, the nodes are stored in such a way that they are physically linked to each other on the disk. This is called “index-free adjacency”\autocite{graphdb2015}, which is in practice done by pointers. Accordingly, searching for a specific information in a native graph storage is implemented by traversing through pointers. This causes queries on native storage to be highly efficient compared to non-native storage which uses join-statements and index lookups \autocite{graphdb2015} .

\subsection{Advantages of Graph Databases}
Graph databases offer substantial advantages when working with connected data \autocite{maheshlal2015}. Its performance, flexibility and agility are the key differences to other databases \autocite{graphdb2015}. The following section will take a closer look at these three advantages. More details and references to actual research data on these advantages can be found in the section Comparison: Graph Databases and Relational Databases (\ref{section:comparison}).

\subsubsection{Performance}
A graph database has much higher query processing performance compared to relational and other NoSQL databases. This advantage becomes more and more prevalent as the size/amount of stored data grows. In the relational world more data would mean a higher join-intensity and thus worse performance. Whereas in the graph database world the performance remains to be almost constant even for an exponential increase of size. This is the cases because queries are being restricted to parts of the graph (e.g. a subgraph) which contains the information of interest.  Therefore, querying only needs time proportional to size of the subgraph and not to the size of the whole graph \autocite{maheshlal2015, graphdb2015}.

\subsubsection{Flexibility}
The flexibility of a graph databases must be understood in the context of the graph database model. The model is flexible and so are graph databases. Furthermore, this flexibility is most apparent for an actual operational graph database in production environments.

The paradigm of fitting data to predefined data models, as in SQL, is neither efficient nor desired by developers. Instead fitting an easily extensible and changeable data model to newly emerging data is more appropriate for fields of graph database applications (See more in the section "Fields of Application”, \ref{section:FoA}). Thereby the process of designing a complex and mostly final data model at the start of the database implementation, a point in time where it is impossible to predict all kinds of data that might be needed in the future, gets replaced by designing a basic data model with the expectation to change it in the future \autocite{maheshlal2015, graphdb2015}.

This process is natively supported by graph databases. All components of a graph model (e.g. for the property graph model: nodes, properties, labels and relationships) can be added to an existing model without invalidating queries already in use. This concept of graph databases also minimizes maintenance cost and risk because the need for migrations (e.g. the equivalent of schema migrations for a relational database) is reduced \autocite{maheshlal2015, graphdb2015}.

\subsubsection{Agility}
In today's agile software development world, where developers need to focus on a certain task for a short time before switching to a different task, software tools that fit this iterative approach are more favorable. Databases that offer data models which can grow with new data meet this requirement. Additionally, databases that offer data models which do represent the data closer to its actual format (e.g. not transferring it into tables) are also more favorable because they reduce the time between design and implementation which is appropriate for the short time a developer may have to implement a database. Lastly, modern test-driven development requires agile databases to be easily testable. \autocite{maheshlal2015, graphdb2015}.

A graph database is “schema-less” \autocite{maheshlal2015}. It does not transform data (e.g. normalization in the SQL world) but rather tries to represent the data as close to its actual format as possible. Furthermore, the application programming interface (API) and query language design of graph database increase testability \autocite{graphdb2015} . Finally, the flexibility of its data model enables the database to evolve with new data. As a result, a graph database has the characteristics to be agile software.

\subsection{Fields of Application} \label{section:FoA}
When reading through use cases described by marketing teams of graph database management systems (for example: Neo4j \autocite{neo4j:why_graphdb, neo4j:use_cases}
), it may feel like any problem could be solved with a graph database. Solving any problem with a graph database may be possible but this fact alone is not a valid reason to do so.

Instead, cost efficiently, compliance with company polices, available developer skills and available time are the primary reasons to choose a graph database for a specific use case. Additionally, replacing existing well-working and established database management systems should have major and urgently needed advantages \autocite{graphdb2015}.

Graph databases can create these advantages for use cases which handle connected data. Below are some short examples of large companies that use graph databases. Subsequently, the top five use cases from the perspective of the graph database management system Neo4j are explained.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Use Case Examples}
\textbf{Social Networks:} Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn use graph databases to manage user information and feed of users. This contains information like updates from friends, news and potential posts of relevance or interest (e.g. Jobs for LinkedIn users) \autocite{maheshlal2015}.

\textbf{Routing:} Prominent navigation services like Google Maps, TomTom and Sygic utilize graph databases for map navigation \autocite{maheshlal2015}.

\textbf{Search:} Google (Google Knowledge Graph) and Facebook (Facebook Social Graph) are also using graph databases for storing the connection of content for search functionalities \autocite{maheshlal2015}.

\textbf{Recommendation:} Walmart and eBay are both using graph databases and value their performance for real-time product recommendations \autocite{neo4j:use_cases}.

\subsubsection{Neo4j Use Cases}
\scalebox{1}{\textbf{Fraud Detection}}

Graph databases are well fit for fraud detection because good detection mechanisms need to analyze the relationships between data. In detail, if the relationships between certain data ojbects is conspicuously high, the risk of fraud is very high.  As an example, take an E-commerce system. A normal user would use one or two credit cards to buy products. A fraudster would use a lot of different credit cards which are most likely stolen. This relationship density between users, credit cards and purchased products is modeled by a graph database and is therefore easily measurable and observable \autocite{neo4j:use_cases}.

As mentioned before, graph databases are built for storing and rapidly traversing relationships, thereby supporting advanced detection mechanisms that need to perform relationship analysis between a lot of data.

\scalebox{1}{\textbf{Real-Time Recommendation Engines}}

A real-time recommendation engine can only be as effective as the database it is using because the engine needs information about the existence, quality and strength of data relationships. Information must either be computed from the database in a time-consuming manner or made available natively, as with graph databases \autocite{neo4j:use_cases}. Graph databases model this information without any additional computation. Existence is modeled by edges (relationships), quality and strength by key-value pairs (properties) of edges.

In addition, the need to easily add and combine data (e.g. user behavior, demographics and their purchase history) and then analyze this new dataset in real time for possible recommendations is crucial for such an engine \autocite{neo4j:use_cases}. A graph database supports simple addition and combination with its already mentioned flexibility. Furthermore, the performance advantage of graph databases in this context is again very favorable when analyzing this new dataset.

\scalebox{1}{\textbf{Master Data Management}}

In a company, master data is data such as users, customers, products, accounts, partners, sites and business units. Identifying, cleaning, storing and governing this data is called Master data management (MDM). Best practice for MDM is to create one master data store which contains the data of the entire company. As a result, any business application that might create or use this data only uses only the same storage system. Hence, the master data store is one storage system for a lot of different applications which still needs to fully function in real time and might need to adapt to new business requirements. Thus, it must provide a purpose-built, dynamic and sometimes unconventional data model \autocite{neo4j:use_cases}. These requirements are perfectly matched by the flexibility and agility of a graph database.

\scalebox{1}{\textbf{Network and Information Technology Operations}}

The structural representation of an information technology (IT) infrastructure network is a graph. Consequently, it should not be a surprise that a graph database is a good solution to model, store and serve requests for an IT infrastructure environment. Information in an IT infrastructure environment are for example device configurations, infrastructure interdependencies, any kind of event (log files, error messages, etc.) and administrative details. Systems that use such information can, in the event of a failure, inform the right administrator about what went wrong where and when in real time \autocite{neo4j:use_cases}.

A graph database is not only able to model the network in its native representation but is also able to add all this information to its storage with ease. Network administrators are nodes with connection to their devices and field of responsibility (subgraphs). Configurations are properties of device nodes. Any interdependencies are represented by relationships. Lastly, events are nodes linked to the device that created it. This requirement for a native data model and sufficent performance is fulfilled by a graph database.

\scalebox{1}{\textbf{Identity and Access Management}}

The process of deciding which identity can access which resource is called identity and access management (IAM). This decision process also needs to utilize information about identities (e.g.  administrators, users), resources (e.g.  files, devices) and rules (e.g. “user X can access file Y”) that must be stored somewhere. Conventional storage options, like directory services or application specific solutions, tend to be unsuitable because they cannot manage the required complex interconnection structures of big organizations or are too slow for bigger datasets \autocite{neo4j:use_cases}.  Whereas a graph database is a valid solution because its agility allows the developer to easily model the complex structures and its performance does not slow down for bigger datasets.


\subsection{Comparison: Graph Databases and Relational Databases} \label{section:comparison}
As the comparison between Graph Databases and Relational Databases is a known field, a lot of literature exists on this topic already. Throughout the comparisons, the two methods are always assessed under the same aspects: performance, flexibility, security and maturity. \\
For those comparison points it makes sense to focus on specific implementations of the technologies, hence in this section Neo4j will be chosen as a concrete precedent for Graph Databases, whereas MySQL will be the example implementation for Relational Databases.

\subsubsection{Performance}
Detailed surveys on performance of both technologies already exist in literature, for example from Vicknais et al. \autocite{Vicknair2010}. In this specific instance, MySQL version 5.1.42 and Neo4j-b11 were compared.
The queries chosen for the experiments were similar to types that are used in real world provenance systems. Typically in this scenario, for one dataset/node one traverses the graph to find its origin. Another use case in this context is, if a data object or node is deemed incorrect, this information needs to be propagated to all its descendants/child nodes \autocite{Vicknair2010}.\\
Further on, the queries were partitioned into structural queries referencing the graph but not the payload itsself, and data queries using the actual payload data. It is important to note that the payload data in this case was integer payload data, as different types are handled seperately depending on framework.\\
In the traversal queries, Neo4j clearly outperformed MySQL, sometimes even being faster by the factor of 10. Though that was expected, as Relational Databases are not designed for traversals. MySQL for this part of experiment falls back to a standard Breath First Search, which is not optimal for this scenario. Neo4j on the other hand has a built in framework for traversals, making it superior in terms of performance for the traversal queries \autocite{Vicknair2010}. \\
Contrary to that, in the data queries MySQL turned out to be more efficient. This result was partly due to the fact that Neo4j uses Lucene for querying, which treats all payload as text, eventhough in this scenario the payload is of type integer. But also when the payload changes to text, MySQL had better performance in the experiments \autocite{Vicknair2010}. \\
The researchers also took into account a special case for the experiments, trying the data queries with payload that is closer to actual real world data - text with spaces inbetween the words. Surprisingly, at a large enough scale Nao4j outperformed MySQL by a large amount for those queries.

\subsubsection{Flexibility}
The flexibility aspect compares both database technologies in their behaviour when taken out of the environment that they were created for \autocite{Vicknair2010}. \\
For Relational Databases an uncommon environment would for example be ad-hoc data schemes that change with time, whereas for Graph Databases a less typical dataset would be one without many connections between the individual nodes  \autocite{GarimaAnalysis}.
MySQL is optimized for a large-scale multi-user environment, hence trying to use it for smaller applications comes with a large overhead of functionality that has to be implemented with it but that may not even be needed for this specific application.
Neo4j is typically targeted towards more lightweight applications, but manages to scale really well, having a scalable architecture that also accounts for speed \autocite{neo4jweb}. Its easily mutable schema makes it more flexible with data types that are rather untypical for Graph Databases.

\subsubsection{Security}
Neo4j does not have built in mechanisms for managing security restrictions and multiple users \autocite{GarimaAnalysis}. MySQL on the other hand natively supports multiple users as well as access control lists. \autocite{mysqlsecurity}

\subsubsection{Maturity}
For the comparison under the aspect of maturity it makes sense to talk about database implementations in general. Maturity refers both to how old a particular system is and to how thoroughly tested it is \autocite{Vicknair2010}.
Since all Relational databases - inclusing MySQL - use the same query language SQL, support is equal over all implementations and support for one implementation is applicable to all others \autocite{GarimaAnalysis}.
Neo4js version 1.1 was released in February 2010. While Neo4j is a for-profit framework and has decent support from its parenty company, this does not apply to all graph database implementations \autocite{Vicknair2010}. Furthermore, the query languages differ from implementation to implementation, separating them in that aspect and not sharing support??.


\section{Implementing a Graph Database Model}
This section shall outline the general approach, how to convert an existing relational database model into a property graph model.
In the second part an introdcution to Neo4j, the implementation of a database model in Python and basic querying in an application and with Neo4js own query language \glqq Cypher\grqq{} will follow.

\subsection{Converting a Relational Database Model}
There are a couple of guides available describing how to build a database model for Neo4j. Since the database itself is schema-less, multiple schemas can be used and implemented at the same time.
Nevertheless an application needs a model of the data.
Neo4j states in \autocite{neo4j:rel_to_graph} that it is possible to transfer almost all existing relational models into a graph model.
The general approach has been described in \autocite{dzone:rel_to_graph}.
The first step in this conversion is to consider the names of all Non-JOIN-Tables as labels.
Foreign keys will become relations.
JOIN-Tables will be converted into relations as well with additional properties added to the relation \autocite{neo4j:graph_vs_rdbms}.
The rows will be converted into nodes connected by edges based on the formerly converted relations. Attributes not covered in the previous steps will become properties of a node.

\subsection{Implementing a sample project with Neo4j}
In this section the modeling and setup with Neo4j will be lined out and a sample project be described utilizing available Python-Libraries to implement a sample project.
There are two different available versions of Neo4j.
First of all there is the Open Source community edition which is published under the GPL.
Additionally Neo4j Inc sells licences for an enterprise edition \autocite{neo4j:editions} including support and several additional features, such as replication, multiple users, several query perfomance optimizations and no limitation for the number of nodes in the database (the community version is limited at 34 Billion nodes).
The following examples have been implemented and tested with the community edition.

\subsubsection{Setting up Neo4j}
Neo4j is available for Windows, Linux and Mac and can be installed via the provided packages. While there is a minimum requirement of 2GB of RAM, Neo4j recommends 16GB or more \autocite[Chapter~2.1]{neo4j:op_manual}.
Since Neo4j is implemented in Java, starting it can be done by invoking it with a Java runtime of choice installed. The default configuration does not need to be modified to get started.

\paragraph{High availability} \label{par:graphdb:ha} The community edition of Neo4j does not allow to set up a cluster of multiple Neo4j instances.
This feature is reserved for the enterprise version.
The setup of a causally consistent cluster is explained in the documentation \autocite[Chapter~5.1]{neo4j:op_manual}.
The reference architecture as shown in \autoref{fig:graphdb:causal_cluster} recommends an odd number of at least three \glqq Core Servers\grqq{} connected into a RAFT-Cluster handling mostly write requests.
They ensure consistency of the data.
Connected to this core cluster may be an arbitrary number of \glqq Read Servers\grqq.
They only handle the -- sometimes ressource costly -- read requests but are not relevant to the clusters integrity.
Information from Core Servers is replicated asynchronously to the read replicas.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img/causal_clustering.png}
    \caption{Neo4j causal Cluster Architecture \autocite[Chapter~5.1]{neo4j:op_manual}}
    \label{fig:graphdb:causal_cluster}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Classification of Neo4j within the CAP Theorem} For this kind of classification it is again necessary to differentiate between the community and the enterprise edition.
Since it is not possible to set up a Neo4j-Cluster with the community edition it can not be considered a distributed system.
Therefore the CAP-Theorem is not applicable \autocite{dzone:understanding_cap}.

As mentioned in \autoref{par:graphdb:ha} the enterprise edition can be set up as a causal cluster.
Causal consistency though does not fulfill the criteria Brewer put out for consistency \autocite{DBLP:journals/corr/Kleppmann15} so it can not be considered as \glqq C\grqq{} under the CAP Theorem.
It is important to note that a causal cluster is still ACID compliant.
Due to the nature of the core servers using a consensus-based protocol (RAFT) availability in case of a network partition only applies to the majority of the cluster \autocite{infoq:neo4j}.
This does make them partition tolerant though, fulfilling all criteria for \glqq P\grqq.

According to Michael Hunger, one of the Neo4j developers, the causal cluster architecture can be considered as a \glqq CP\grqq{} system \autocite{infoq:neo4j}.
Considering the the concerns lined out by Martin Kleppmann in his blog post \autocite{kleppmann:caprant} Neo4j should be considered as \glqq P\grqq{} -- if no alternative to CAP is considered as proposed by him \autocite{DBLP:journals/corr/Kleppmann15}.


\subsubsection{Modeling the graph database}
The sample project maps the relations within users in a social network.
\autoref{fig:graphdb:graphmodel} outlines a data model with circles representing nodes. They are connected by edges showing their relationships.
For this example labels are represented as colours.
In this sample model there may be an arbitrary number of persons (orange), who may be friends with other persons.
Additionally, they can share interests (green) and may be a member of a group (purple).
Furthermore they can state from which country (yellow) they are from.

\subsubsection{Implementation in Python}
While it is possible to manage the database utilizing the CRUD-functionality from Neo4js own query language Cypher (see \ref{sec:graphdb:cypher}) this is not really suitable for an application.
Developers familiar with Object-Relational-Mappers (ORM) such as Hibernate for Java or SQLAlchemy for Python would prefer to define the different nodes and relations in classes providing the database elements as objects and abstracting actual SQL-Queries.

For Python there exists a community driven project called neomodel \autocite{github:neomodel} aiming to provide an Object-Graph-Mapper (OGM) for Python projects. Neomodel is published under the MIT License.

\begin{listing}[ht]
    \begin{minted}{python}
    class Partnership(StructuredRel):
        since = DateTimeProperty(
            default=lambda: datetime.now(pytz.utc)
        )

    class Country(StructuredNode):
        name = StringProperty(unique_index=True, required=True)

    class Interest(StructuredNode):
        name = StringProperty(unique_index=True, required=True)

    class Group(StructuredNode):
        name = StringProperty(unique_index=True, required=True)

    class Person(StructuredNode):
        uid = UniqueIdProperty()
        name = StringProperty(unique_index=True)
        age = IntegerProperty(index=True, default=0)

        # traverse outgoing relations
        country = RelationshipTo(Country, 'IS_FROM')
        interests = RelationshipTo(Interest, 'IS_INTERESTED_IN')
        groups = RelationshipTo('Group', 'IS_MEMBER')
        friends = Relationship('Person', 'FRIENDS_WITH', model=Partnership)
    \end{minted}

    \label{lst:graphdb:neomodel}
\end{listing}

The implementation of the graph model mentioned in \autoref{fig:graphdb:graphmodel} in Python has been realized in \autoref{lst:graphdb:neomodel} following the neomodel documentation \autocite{neomodel:rtd}. With this model it is possible to create new nodes in the database by instantiating a new object of the given classes as in \autoref{lst:graphdb:createPerson}.
\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}{python}
lmeitner = Person(name='Lise Meitner', age=89)
lmeitner.save()
\end{minted}
\caption{Creating a new person node in the database}
\label{lst:graphdb:createPerson}
\end{listing}

To connect two nodes it is necessary to get both objects and to invoke the \texttt{connect()} method as seen in \autoref{lst:graphdb:connectNodes} on one of them.
The \texttt{get\char`_or\char`_create} method simplifies creation of nodes with no additional properties since it either returns an already existing node or creates it.
\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}{python}
country = Country.get_or_create({'name': 'Austria'})
lmeitner.country.connect(country[0])
\end{minted}
\caption{Connecting a person and a country node}
\label{lst:graphdb:connectNodes}
\end{listing}

Retrieving one or more existing nodes can be done by filtering as shown in \autoref{lst:graphdb:queryPerson}.
\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}{python}
curie = Person.nodes.filter(name='Marie Curie')
\end{minted}
\caption{Querying for a person node by the name attribute}
\label{lst:graphdb:queryPerson}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{Queries using Cypher}
\label{sec:graphdb:cypher}
Neo4j provides its own query language Cypher. It is developed with an open source specification called openCypher \autocite{openCypher}.
Thus it should be possible to use the same query language for graph processing in other databases -- such as SAP HANA or Redis.
Its syntax is oriented on SQL statements though there are quite some differences to better match with a graph model.
Neo4j has an extensive introduction how to use Cypher \autocite{neo4j:cypher_introduction}.
Therefore only a short introduction should be given here.

Cypher uses two basic patterns.
First of all there are nodes, denoted by enclosing parentheses.
The second pattern is used for relationships.
They are expressed by two dashes and may have a direction utilizing the greater-than/less-than signs.
Furthermore, the type of a relationship may be specified in brackets between the two dashes.

A few examples will make it easier to understand how these patterns can be used.

The simplest query would be to get all nodes and all relations between them without regard to their labels.
This can be achieved by calling \mint{SQL}|MATCH (n) RETURN n|
It is important to note that Cypher uses \texttt{MATCH} as a keyword similar to SQLs \texttt{SELECT}.
Contrary to SQL it is necessary in Cypher to \texttt{RETURN} the previously matched nodes to obtain them in the result.
It is possible to declare the label of a node by calling \mint{SQL}|MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p|
This would reduce the output to all persons and the relations between them.

As mentioned before Cypher supports a pattern for relations.
To include them in a query -- e.g. for all Persons who have one or more friends the query would look like \mint{SQL}|MATCH (a:Person) -[:FRIENDS_WITH]- (b:Person) RETURN a, b|
The relationship type in the brackets may be ommited to get all types of relations between these nodes.

Similar to SQL, Cypher also supports a \texttt{WHERE} statement.
To query for a specific Person where the attribute \texttt{name} equals \glqq Otto Hahn\grqq{} and all nodes connected to this person the Cypher query would look like this \mint{SQL}|MATCH (p:Person)-[r]-(n) WHERE p.name = 'Otto Hahn' RETURN p, r, n|

Of course Cypher offers a complete keyword set for all types of CRUD operations. Interested readers should follow the introduction by Neo4j \autocite{neo4j:cypher_introduction}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
Getting started with Neo4j is relatively simple.
There is plenty of documentation available helping to implement a database model and an application based on it.
Especially the OGM Projects for Python are pretty advanced and suitable for production usage.
Users familiar with SQL will find Cypher not that difficult to get used to.

There are two major downsides to Neo4j. The first one is the memory footprint.
A newly set up instance already consumes more than 600MB of RAM -- in comparison, a PostgreSQL instance storing a couple hundred MB of data still consumes less than half of that.
The second downside is, that many features -- especially regarding maintenance and clustering -- are preserved for the enterprise edition and not available in the open source community edition. This makes it difficult if not impossible to use the community edition in a production environment.
